"Yeah, hahahaha...whooooo, shit!"
Guess what? I ain't coming in yet...
I'll come in a minute
Ayo...This is my love song...it goes like this
Back when Mark Walhberg was Marky Mark
This is how we used to make the party start
We used to mix Hen' with Bacardi Dark
"And when it, kicks in you can hardly talk"
"And by the, sixth gin you're gonna probably crawl"
"And you'll be, sick then and you'll probably barf"
And my pre-diction is you're gonna probably fall
Either somewhere in the lobby or the hallway wall
And everything's spinning
You're beginin' to think women
are swimming in pink linen again in the sink
Then in a couple of minutes that bottle of Guinness is finished
You are now allowed to officially slap bitches
You have the right to remain violent and start wilin'
Start a fight with the same guy that was smart eyin' you
"Get in your car, start it, and start drivin'"
Over the island and cause a 42 car pile-up
"Earth calling, pilot to co-pilot"
"Looking at the life on this planet, sir, no sign of it"
All I can see is a bunch of smoke flyin'
And I'm so high that I might die if I go by it
Let me out of this place
I'm outta place
I'm in outer space
I've just vanished without a trace
I'm going to a pretty place now where the flowers grow
I'll be back in an hour or so
'Cause every time I go to try to leave
Someone keeps pullin' on my sleeve
"I don't wanna, but I gotta stay"
These drugs really got a hold of me
"'Cause every time I try to tell them ""no"""
They won't let me ever let them go
I'm a sucker all I gotta say
These drugs really got a hold of me
"In third grade, all I used to do"
Was sniff glue through a tube and play Rubic's cube
17 years later I'm as Rude as Jude
Scheming on the first chick with the hugest boobs
I've got no game
And every face looks the same
They've got no name
So I don't need game to play
I just say whatever I want to whoever I want
"Whenever I want, wherever I want, however I want"
"However, I do show some respect to few"
As ecstasy got me standing next to you
Getting sentimental as fuck spillin' guts to you
We just met
But I think I'm in love with you
But you're on it too
So you tell me you love me too
"Wake up in the morning like ""yo, what the fuck we do?"""
I gotta go bitch
You know I have stuff to do
'Cause if I get caught cheatin' then I'm stuck with you
But in the long run
These drugs are probably going to catch up sooner or later
"But fuck it, I'm on one"
So let's enjoy
Let the X destroy your spinal cord
So it's not a straight line no more
'Til we walk around looking like some wind-up dolls
Shit's sticking out of our backs like a dinosaur
"Shit, six hits won't even get me high no more"
So bye for now
I'm going to try to find some more
That's the sound of a bottle when it's hollow
When you swallow it all wallow and drown in your sorrow
And tomorrow you're probably going to want to do it again
What's a little spinal fluid between you and a friend? Screw it
And what's a little bit of alcohol poisoning?
And what's a little fight?
Tomorrow you'll be boys again
It's your life
Live it however you wanna
Marijuana is everywhere
Where was you brought up?
It don't matter as long as you get where you're going
'Cause none of the shit is going to mean shit where we're going
"They tell you to stop, but you just sit there ignoring"
Even though you wake up feeling like shit every morning
But you're young
You've got a lot of drugs to do
Girls to screw
Parties to crash
Sucks to be you
"If I could take it all back now, I wouldn't"
I would have did more shit that people said that I shouldn't
But I'm all grown up now and upgraded and graduated
Did better drugs and updated
But I've still got a lot of growing up to do
I've still got a whole lot of throwing up to spew
But when it's all said and done I'll be 40
Before I know it with a 40 on the porch telling stories
With a bottle of Jack
Two grandkids in my lap
Babysitting for Hailie while Hailie's out getting smashed
Drugs really got a hold of me
They really got a hold of me
'Cause drugs really got a hold of me
They really got a hold of me
Wake up this morning I'm shaking I can't be still girl
Too many images running through my mind
"Soon as I hit it, I can't get it out my system"
Even my brother he asked me what you on
I'm on some kind of drug
Can't explain all the ways you get me high
I'm on some kind of drug
"Can't explain, don't keep me waiting all night"
"Girl come through, them bath water running"
Fire be burning in my hotel room
"Come through, champagne be popping"
System be knocking in my hotel room
"Ever since I met you, you got me changing my schedule"
"If you ain't know, that shits eventful"
"And losing this money is dreadful, but"
"Believe me, that pussy is special"
"You wanna meet moms, I might let you"
Rollie is soo presidential
"Keep it on while we fuck that's cause I meant to, yeah"
"Fuck you twice, we take a nap, soon as you're awake, get back"
Go for three it takes a nack
I'm taking you to places that
"You ain't been girl, face the fact, meant it, I can't take it back"
"Whisky straight, ain't chasing that, I'll taste the cat, yeah"
"Yeah, you told me I own that pearl"
"Yeah, that's cause I bone you thorough"
You should be my only girl
"When I hit it, you feel like you own the world"
I'm on some kind of drug
Can't explain all the ways you get me high
I'm on some kind of drug
"Can't explain, don't keep me waiting all night"
"Girl come through, that bath water running"
Fire be burning in my hotel room
"Come through, champagne be popping"
System be knocking in my hotel room
Since the last time we had sex
"Honestly, I've been a mess, well"
Fienin cause you got the best
Borderline kind of obsessed and yeah
I'm on some kind of drug
I've been addicted and I cannot find enough
"I call you, I'm tryna fuck, I'm in room 921, come on up"
"And we could put up the ""please do not disturb"""
"I got drink, I got the herb, I'm tweakin', now I must be cured"
The only way I rest assured is if... I get my fix
I love the way your dress just slips
"Right off your waist, right down your hips"
"Technique's the best, she knows some tricks and yeah"
"I need you now, I need you bad"
You and me both of us been fienin' bad
I guess what I really mean is that...yeah
I'm on some kind of drug
Can't explain all the ways you get me high
I'm on some kind of drug
"Can't explain, don't keep me waiting all night"
"Girl come through, that bath water running"
Fire be burning in my hotel room
"Come through, champagne be popping"
System be knocking in my hotel room
"Girl come through, that bath water running"
Fire be burning in my hotel room
"Come through, champagne be popping"
System be knocking in my hotel room
We ain't playin anymore
Privacy on the door
We ain't playin anymore
Privacy on the door
When we finish baby
Ain't gon' need no more
Cause I had the best of the worst sides
And I had these lungs
And I had too many flash fires
That I just let them burn
Till my chest is on fire
And my head just won't die
I guess I'm lying cause I wanna
I guess I'm lying cause I don't
Cause I just feel so tired
Like it's move or slowly die
You ain't you when you're like this
This ain't you and you know it
But ain't that just the point?
You don't know how to let go
Who said this must be all or nothing?
"But I'm still caught below, and I'll never let you know"
No I can't tell you nothing
Cause I'm a fucking mess sometimes
But still I could always be
Whatever you wanted
But not what you needed
Especially when you been needing me
Cause I'm a fucking mess sometimes
And I'll say what I don't mean
Just cause I wanted
Or maybe I need it
Swear lying's the only rush I need
Cause all I needed was some words to say
That all these feelings don't mean shit to me
"Cause it's all just chemicals anyway, anyway, yeah"
And I got way too many routes to take
To make this all just go away
And find another heart to break
So heartless with the words I say
Just saying what I'm supposed to say
Cause I had nothing for you
I can't love when I can't even love myself
Things I would rather be thoughts at the back of my head
But I'm addicted to hurting
And I got these lungs
And I spent too many late nights
Just Thinking a hole in the earth
Till the sky is on fire
And my head still won't die
I guess I'm lying cause I wanna
I guess I'm lying cause I don't
Cause I just feel so tired
Like I need something to come alive
"She said, ""You ain't you when you're like this"
"This ain't you, what you done?"""
"And I said, ""That's the point"""
You don't know how to let go
Who said this must be all or nothing?
"But I'm still caught below, and I'll never let you know"
No I can't tell you nothing
Cause I'm a fucking mess sometimes
But still I could always be
"Whatever you wanted, but not what you needed"
Especially when you been needing me
Cause I'm a fucking mess inside
And I'll say what I don't mean
"Just cause I wanted, or maybe I need it"
Swear lying's the only rush I need
What is that funny light and sound
"Calling me, in my head, repeatedly?"
What is that vision there in sight
Before my eyes?
So prominent
"So mesmerising, turbulent"
You've got a hold on me
Your ingenuity
Seems to be driving me down on my knees
The force you generate
You reinvigorate
Your body tells them 'No mistakes'
For I'm already drawn
Close to the divine
Intoxicating images are rushing through my mind
"Embodiment of sin, has seen a way within"
Sensation seems to multiply
They're building up inside
Carried through the night
Radiating light
I see you move the crowd
I know what you're about
The stories I have heard
To talk about excess
I know what people say
But surely you impress?
Caressed by a pill
You elevated soul
Vanity and pride
An addict to one
A universal force
A one and only kind
A thing I can't control
No matter how I try
What have you done to me?
This kind of chemistry
Emotions running over me
And when you arch your back
Just when you stay like that
When it's natural to interact
When others holding back
Ready to commence
Caught up in your bliss
You're so confusing and intense
Synergy of two
Energy go wild
See the stars aligned to spell
Our name out in the sky
Jealousy in sight
So fascinating ride
So much faith between
Floating up the steam
Calling out so loud
Beautiful and true
Mystery about
Everything you do
Caressed by a drug
You elevated soul
Vanity and pride
An addict to one
A universal force
A one and only kind
A thing I can't control
No matter how I try
This electricity
Injected into me
Emotions running over me
And when you're getting close
You touch my innermost
A feeling deep inside me knows
On a floaty light
Carried through the night
We have got it all
I get through without
Flowing in my veins
Ribbing through my soul
I'll never be the same
The secret can't be told
Charismatic pill
You elevated soul
Vanity and pride
An addict to one
A universal force
A one and only kind
A thing I can't control
No matter how I try
Let me take you down
'Cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
Living is easy with eyes closed
Misunderstanding all you see
It's getting hard to be someone
But it all works out
It doesn't matter much to me1
Let me take you down
'Cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
No one I think is in my tree
I mean it must be high or low
That is you know you can't tune it
But it's all right
That is I think it's not too bad
Let me take you down
'Cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
Always know sometimes it's me
But you know I know when it's a dream
"I think I know I mean a ""Yes"""
But it's all wrong
That is I think I disagree
Let me take you down
'Cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever

It seemed the lower I go
The better I begin to feel.
"I don’t want this life,"
If nothing I feel is real.
Don’t act so concerned.
I tried my fucking best.
But letting go was never an option.
I’ve got this hole stuck in my chest.
Let go.
That’s what you said.
But letting go was never an option.
I tried my fucking best.
Let go.
That’s what you said.
But letting go was never an option.

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
"Yeah, I woke up around 12"
Looked to my right found a bag on the shelf

And i don't give a fuck if it's bad for my health
I'm mad stressed out
Cause last week see my girl just left out
I went to roll another j and I'm fresh out
And see I'm bummed i ain't even get none last night when i went out
"Damn, and now the room's all hazy"
Eyes start to look Asian when I'm blazey
Think I'm about to lay around today and be lazy
Maybe might call a squeeze over to amaze me
"Yeah, as you can see i've got some issues"
I've got my medical card it's gettin' misuse
So I'm stop it if it's bammer? I'm off it
I'm cheech with a fatty full of maui wowie dog shit
"[You mean we're smokin' dog shit, man?]"
"G-Eazy, Mod Sun!"

Take a hit to the mic right before my verse but..
"I'm hippie hop, 70's mentality type shit"
"Came from a family, hipp-ays"
My parents both smoked J's in '70s
See even when my mom was pregnant she still blazed
So i've been high before I even lived one day(zed)
But I ain't confused
"Could chop it any way, whatever paraphernalia you choose"
Ain't nothin' bar on top night for solar puffin vapor
Space cake whatever [it takes to get us copper?]
And we do that!
Yeah we blazed it and strained a lot of eyes? for tastin?
Sour d without the Brooklyn based me
[?] straight from the guy that raised it
Don't say shit
Faded but not so vibrant
Never been to high to keep climbin'
Got a fresh crop but a harvest moon
Wake and bake with me I guarantee every day just like a sunny afternoon
"G, hit me up"
Said he was on some 1967 type shit
See that's where I am
Mod Sun
Hippie hop
M.O.D. and some air

Crumblin' the herb and rollin' it up in the Swishers
"Kush is my cologne, every minute blowin' heavy"
"I don't smoke it on occasion, everyday is 4/20"
"All I do is flame shit, I don't do that change shit"

"Look at who I came with, better fix ya face quick"
Cause I gotta lot of muh-fuckers with me we all on the same shit
"Now pass me the dutching-ton,"

Order up a quarter my connect is on the phone
Mix the purple with the lemon G kush and get stoned
"God damn it im gone, blowin' with the wind"

Black lights on the tats glowin' on my skin
And my blunt is never lonely all my L's got twins blaze up!

"So what the fuck blaze up, ugh, blaze up, kels Blaze up"

And if they hear me fuck the police say it loud
20 dollars and a dream bitch I'm livin'
"Back strokin' in yo girl, no swimmin'"

Hundred words and runnin
Lace up. lace up bitch. EST blaze up

"So what's up man?

Chilling chilling?
"Yo you know I had to call, you know why right?"
Why?
"Because, yo, I never ever call and ask, you to play something right?"
Yeah
You know what I wanna hear right?
"What you wanna hear?
I wanna hear that Wu-Tang joint"
Wu-Tang again?
"Ah yeah, again and again!"
"Wu-Tang Clan coming at you, protect your neck kid, so set it off the Inspector Deck"
[Meth] watch your step kid [8X]
I smoke on the mic like smoking Joe Frazier
"The hell raiser, raising hell with the flavor"
Terrorize the jam like troops in Pakistan
Swinging through your town like your neighborhood Spiderman
"So uhh, tic toc and keep ticking"
While I get you flipping off the shit I'm kicking
"The Lone Ranger, code red, danger!"
Deep in the dark with the art to rip charts apart
"The vandal, too hot to handle"
"you battle, you're saying Goodbye like Tevin Campbell"
"Roughneck, Inspector Deck's on the set"
"The rebel, I make more noise than heavy metal"
"The way I make the crowd go wild, sit back relax won't smile"
"Rae got it going on pal, call me the rap assassinator"
Rhymes rugged and built like Schwarzenegger
"And I'm gonna get mad deep like a threat, blow up your project"
Then take all your assets
Cause I came to shake the frame in half
"With the thoughts that bomb, shit like math!"
So if you wanna try to flip go flip on the next man
Cause I grab the clip and
Hit you with sixteen shots and more I got
Going to war with the melting pot hot
It's the Method Man for short Mr. Meth
"Moving on your left, ah!"
"And set it off, get it off, let it off like a gat"
"I wanna break full, cock me back"
"Small change, they putting shame in the game"
I take aim and blow that nigga out the frame
"And like Fame, my style'll live forever"
"Niggaz crossing over, but they don't know no better"
"But I do, true, can I get a ""sue"""
Nuff respect due to the one-six-oh
"I mean oh, you check out the flow"
like the Hudson or PCP when I'm dusting
Niggaz off because I'm hot like sauce
The smoke from the lyrical blunt makes me [cough]
"Oh, what, grab my nut get screwed"
"Ow, here comes my Shaolin style"
"Sloop, B. A. Buh-B. Y. U"
"to my crew with the ""sue"""
watch your step kid
[Ol Dirty Bastard] c'mon baby baby c'mon
"[RZA] Yo, you best protect your neck"
First things first man you're fucking with the worst
I'll be sticking pins in your head like a fucking nurse
I'll attack any nigga who's slack in his mack
Come fully packed with a fat rugged stack
Shame on you when you stepped through to
The Ol Dirty Bastard straight from the Brooklyn Zoo
And I'll be damned if I let any man
"Come to my center, you enter the winter"
Straight up and down that shit packed jam
"You can't slam, don't let me get fool on him man"
The Ol Dirty Bastard is dirty and stinking
"Ason, unique rolling with the night of the creeps"
Niggaz be rolling with a stash
"ain't saying cash, bite my style I'll bite your motherfucking ass!"
For crying out loud my style is wild so book me
Not long is how long that this rhyme took me
"Ejecting, styles from my lethal weapon"
My pen that rocks from here to Oregon
"Here's Mordigan, catch it like a psycho flashback"
"I love gats, if rap was a gun, you wouldn't bust back"
I come with shit that's all types of shapes and sounds
And where I lounge is my stomping grounds
I give a order to my peeps across the water
To go and snatch up props all around the border
And get far like a shooting star
'cause who I am is dim in the light of Pablo Escobar
Point blank as I kick the square biz
There it is you're fucking with pros and there it goes
You chill with the feedback black we don't need that
"It's ten o'clock hoe, where the fuck's your seed at?"
"Feeling mad hostile, ran the apostle"
Flowing like Christ when I speaks the gospel
Stroll with the holy roll then attack the globe with the buckus style
"the ruckus, ten times ten men committing mad sin"
Turn the other cheek and I'll break your fucking chin
Slaying boom-bangs like African drums (we'll be)
Coming around the mountain when I come
Crazy flamboyant for the rap enjoyment
My clan increase like black unemployment
"Yeah, another one dare,"
Tuh-took a genius (to) take us the fuck outta here
The Wu is too slamming for these Cold Killing labels
Some ain't had hits since I seen Aunt Mabel
Be doing artists in like Cain did Abel
Now they money's gettin stuck to the gum under the table
That's what you get when you misuse what I invent
Your empire falls and you lose every cent
For trying to blow up a scrub
Now that thought was just as bright as a 20-watt light bulb
Should've pumped it when I rocked it
Niggaz so stingy they got short arms and deep pockets
This goes on in some companies
With majors they're scared to death to pump these
"First of all, who's your A&R"
A mountain climber who plays an electric guitar
But he don't know the meaning of dope
When he's looking for a suit and tie rap
that's cleaner than a bar of soap
And I'm the dirtiest thing in sight
Matter of fact bring out the girls and let's have a mud fight
You take Sally and I'll take Sue
There ain't no difference between the two
"Cocaine, running all 'round my brain"
"Headin' down Scott, turnin' up Main"
Looking for that girl who sells cocaine
"Cocaine, runnin' all 'round my brain"
Mmm momma come here quick
That old Cocaine 'bout to make me sick
"Cocaine, runnin' all 'round my brain"
Late last night about a quarter past four
Ladanyi come knockin' down my hotel room door
Where's the cocaine?
It's runnin' all 'round my brain
I was talking to my doctor down at the hospital
"He said, ""Son, it says here you're twenty-seven"
But that's impossible ...
"(Cocaine) You look like you could be forty-five."""
Now I'm losing touch with reality and I'm almost out of blow
It's such a fine line I hate to see it go
"Cocaine, runnin' all 'round my brain"
I heard somebody fixed today
There was no last goodbyes to say
His will to live ran out
I heard somebody turned to dust
Looking back at what he left
A list of plans and photographs
Songs that never will be sung
These are the things he don't get done
"I've seen the man use the needle, seen the needle use the man"
I've seen them crawl from the cradle to the gutter on their hands
"They fight a war but it's fatal, it's so hard to understand"
"I've seen the man use the needle, seen the needle use the man"
Just one shot to say goodbye
One last taste to mourn and cry
"Scores and shoots, the lights go dim"
Just one shot to do him in
He hangs his head and wonders why
Why the monkey only lies
"But pay the pauper, he did choose"
He hung his head inside the noose
"I've seen the man use the needle, seen the needle use the man"
I've seen them crawl from the cradle to the gutter on their hands
"They fight a war but it's fatal, it's so hard to understand"
"I've seen the man use the needle, seen the needle use the man"
"Cryptic writing on the wall, the beginning of the end"
"I've seen myself use the needle, seen the needle in my hand"
Blood keeps drinking away
Certain of its destination
Driving through new orleans at night
Gotta find a destination
Just one fix
Life keeps slipping away
Fighting in a war with damnation
"Poised, keep cutting away"
I'm looking in through to salvation
Just one fix
Like if I boarded a train
Trying to take in another station
Join us and the choice will be made
Unless we kill the lie as a nation

"Welcome, to some shit that’s considered legendary"
I’m here to put the rap game in the cemetery
They told me it couldn’t happen
Ain’t no way in hell you gon' make millions off of rapping
But I’m just so determined
Catch me on the stage spitting verses like a sermon
You know I had to make 'em realize
"Lights, camera, action, mofucker check the real in my eyes"
Now they all looking so surprised
"The dawn of a new era, like the sun I arise"
"Through these lyrics, I am immortalized"
Strictly spitting the truth but the rest is telling more lies
This the type of shit most people fantasize
But this the shit I used to analyze
They told me I was too underground
So I took the mic out my basement and found another sound
"I want it, I need it, I’m coming for the crown"
"Can’t nobody stop me, I’m Rocky lets go another round"
I’m kinda on my Roc-A-Fella meets Nelson Mandela
"Raining money, no umbrella flow"
Most of these people they will never know
What you have to sacrifice as a person to truly grow
See I'm in love with this shorty right
But first I gotta get this story right
Cause in this business love will never last
"Sold out shows, hoes, and a whole lot of ass"
Damn what a concoction
But these hoes ain't an option
Cause a woman what I'm looking for
A girl with wisdom that give me brain so insane
Or maybe I'm just going insane
"On the road to success, so I'm living in the fast lane"
"You gotta be hustling, like"
You gotta treat this like you selling drugs...
It's ya boy yo gotti
Chea
Gucci mane the flare
My nigga Ralph in here
Zaytoven on the beat nigga
And it's a street nigga holiday
My Nigga D.J Holiday

"And after this flip I'm quittin' the trap cold turkey, Sike!"
The pack in and I'm workin'

But right now you can get it for a low number
"The fish scale white, Same color my hummer"

So many bricks I can build my own apartment
"Ya better a check, When ya come in my department"

"And I sell em' whole, Try me watch ya whole crew fall like some dominoes"
I got a trap house
And a trap car

All this smoke got me feelin' real nauseous
Ridin' with them bricks got me feelin' real cautious

your government receives from the drug industry.
"Guest: Well, the irony of this, of course, is that"
"this money, which is in the billions, is coming from"
"your country. You see, you are the major purchaser of"
"our national product, which is of course cocaine."
"Host: On one hand, you're saying the United States"
government is spending millions of dollars to
eliminate the flow of drugs onto our streets. At the
"same time, we are doing business with the very same"
government that is flooding our streets with cocaine.

*Two Men Speak in Spanish*
"I'm on the border of Bolivia, working for pennies"
"Treated like a slave, the coke fields have to be ready"
"The spirit of my people is starving, broken and sweaty"
Dreaming about revolution (REVOLUTION!) looking at my machete
But the workload is too heavy to rise up in arms
"And if I ran away, I know they'd probably murder my moms"
"So I pray to ""Heso Preisto"" when I go to the mission"
"Process the cocaine, paced and play my position"
"Ok, listen while I'm out there, just give me my product"
Before we chop off ya hands for worker's misconduct
"I got the power to shoot a copper, and not get charged"
And it would be sad to see your family in front of a firing squad
"So to feed your kids, I need these bricks"
"40 tons in total, let me test it, indeed I (*sniff*)"
"Shit, this is good, pass me a tissue"
"And don't worry about them, I paid off the officials"
"Yo, it don't come as a challenge, I'm the son of some of the foulest"
