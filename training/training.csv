"Yeah, hahahaha...whooooo, shit!",0
Guess what? I ain't coming in yet...,0
I'll come in a minute,0
Ayo...This is my love song...it goes like this,0
Back when Mark Walhberg was Marky Mark,0
This is how we used to make the party start,0
We used to mix Hen' with Bacardi Dark,0
"And when it, kicks in you can hardly talk",0
"And by the, sixth gin you're gonna probably crawl",0
"And you'll be, sick then and you'll probably barf",0
And my pre-diction is you're gonna probably fall,0
Either somewhere in the lobby or the hallway wall,0
And everything's spinning,0
You're beginin' to think women,0
are swimming in pink linen again in the sink,0
Then in a couple of minutes that bottle of Guinness is finished,0
You are now allowed to officially slap bitches,1
You have the right to remain violent and start wilin',1
Start a fight with the same guy that was smart eyin' you,1
"Get in your car, start it, and start drivin'",1
Over the island and cause a 42 car pile-up,1
"Earth calling, pilot to co-pilot",1
"Looking at the life on this planet, sir, no sign of it",1
All I can see is a bunch of smoke flyin',1
And I'm so high that I might die if I go by it,1
Let me out of this place,1
I'm outta place,1
I'm in outer space,1
I've just vanished without a trace,1
I'm going to a pretty place now where the flowers grow,1
I'll be back in an hour or so,1
'Cause every time I go to try to leave,1
Someone keeps pullin' on my sleeve,1
"I don't wanna, but I gotta stay",1
These drugs really got a hold of me,1
"'Cause every time I try to tell them ""no""",1
They won't let me ever let them go,1
I'm a sucker all I gotta say,1
These drugs really got a hold of me,1
"In third grade, all I used to do",1
Was sniff glue through a tube and play Rubic's cube,1
17 years later I'm as Rude as Jude,1
Scheming on the first chick with the hugest boobs,1
I've got no game,1
And every face looks the same,1
They've got no name,1
So I don't need game to play,1
I just say whatever I want to whoever I want,1
"Whenever I want, wherever I want, however I want",1
"However, I do show some respect to few",1
As ecstasy got me standing next to you,1
Getting sentimental as fuck spillin' guts to you,1
We just met,1
But I think I'm in love with you,1
But you're on it too,1
So you tell me you love me too,1
"Wake up in the morning like ""yo, what the fuck we do?""",1
I gotta go bitch,1
You know I have stuff to do,1
'Cause if I get caught cheatin' then I'm stuck with you,1
But in the long run,1
These drugs are probably going to catch up sooner or later,1
"But fuck it, I'm on one",1
So let's enjoy,1
Let the X destroy your spinal cord,1
So it's not a straight line no more,1
'Til we walk around looking like some wind-up dolls,1
Shit's sticking out of our backs like a dinosaur,1
"Shit, six hits won't even get me high no more",1
So bye for now,1
I'm going to try to find some more,1
That's the sound of a bottle when it's hollow,1
When you swallow it all wallow and drown in your sorrow,1
And tomorrow you're probably going to want to do it again,1
What's a little spinal fluid between you and a friend? Screw it,1
And what's a little bit of alcohol poisoning?,1
And what's a little fight?,1
Tomorrow you'll be boys again,1
It's your life,1
Live it however you wanna,1
Marijuana is everywhere,1
Where was you brought up?,1
It don't matter as long as you get where you're going,1
'Cause none of the shit is going to mean shit where we're going,1
"They tell you to stop, but you just sit there ignoring",1
Even though you wake up feeling like shit every morning,1
But you're young,1
You've got a lot of drugs to do,1
Girls to screw,1
Parties to crash,1
Sucks to be you,1
"If I could take it all back now, I wouldn't",1
I would have did more shit that people said that I shouldn't,1
But I'm all grown up now and upgraded and graduated,1
Did better drugs and updated,1
But I've still got a lot of growing up to do,1
I've still got a whole lot of throwing up to spew,1
But when it's all said and done I'll be 40,1
Before I know it with a 40 on the porch telling stories,1
With a bottle of Jack,1
Two grandkids in my lap,1
Babysitting for Hailie while Hailie's out getting smashed,1
Drugs really got a hold of me,1
They really got a hold of me,1
'Cause drugs really got a hold of me,1
They really got a hold of me,1
Wake up this morning I'm shaking I can't be still girl,1
Too many images running through my mind,1
"Soon as I hit it, I can't get it out my system",1
Even my brother he asked me what you on,1
I'm on some kind of drug,1
Can't explain all the ways you get me high,1
I'm on some kind of drug,1
"Can't explain, don't keep me waiting all night",1
"Girl come through, them bath water running",1
Fire be burning in my hotel room,1
"Come through, champagne be popping",1
System be knocking in my hotel room,1
"Ever since I met you, you got me changing my schedule",1
"If you ain't know, that shits eventful",1
"And losing this money is dreadful, but",1
"Believe me, that pussy is special",1
"You wanna meet moms, I might let you",1
Rollie is soo presidential,1
"Keep it on while we fuck that's cause I meant to, yeah",1
"Fuck you twice, we take a nap, soon as you're awake, get back",1
Go for three it takes a nack,1
I'm taking you to places that,1
"You ain't been girl, face the fact, meant it, I can't take it back",1
"Whisky straight, ain't chasing that, I'll taste the cat, yeah",1
"Yeah, you told me I own that pearl",1
"Yeah, that's cause I bone you thorough",1
You should be my only girl,1
"When I hit it, you feel like you own the world",1
I'm on some kind of drug,1
Can't explain all the ways you get me high,1
I'm on some kind of drug,1
"Can't explain, don't keep me waiting all night",1
"Girl come through, that bath water running",1
Fire be burning in my hotel room,1
"Come through, champagne be popping",1
System be knocking in my hotel room,1
Since the last time we had sex,1
"Honestly, I've been a mess, well",1
Fienin cause you got the best,1
Borderline kind of obsessed and yeah,1
I'm on some kind of drug,1
I've been addicted and I cannot find enough,1
"I call you, I'm tryna fuck, I'm in room 921, come on up",1
"And we could put up the ""please do not disturb""",1
"I got drink, I got the herb, I'm tweakin', now I must be cured",1
The only way I rest assured is if... I get my fix,1
I love the way your dress just slips,1
"Right off your waist, right down your hips",1
"Technique's the best, she knows some tricks and yeah",1
"I need you now, I need you bad",1
You and me both of us been fienin' bad,1
I guess what I really mean is that...yeah,1
I'm on some kind of drug,1
Can't explain all the ways you get me high,1
I'm on some kind of drug,1
"Can't explain, don't keep me waiting all night",1
"Girl come through, that bath water running",1
Fire be burning in my hotel room,1
"Come through, champagne be popping",1
System be knocking in my hotel room,1
"Girl come through, that bath water running",1
Fire be burning in my hotel room,1
"Come through, champagne be popping",1
System be knocking in my hotel room,1
We ain't playin anymore,1
Privacy on the door,1
We ain't playin anymore,1
Privacy on the door,1
When we finish baby,1
Ain't gon' need no more,1
Cause I had the best of the worst sides,1
And I had these lungs,1
And I had too many flash fires,1
That I just let them burn,1
Till my chest is on fire,1
And my head just won't die,1
I guess I'm lying cause I wanna,1
I guess I'm lying cause I don't,1
Cause I just feel so tired,1
Like it's move or slowly die,1
You ain't you when you're like this,1
This ain't you and you know it,1
But ain't that just the point?,1
You don't know how to let go,1
Who said this must be all or nothing?,1
"But I'm still caught below, and I'll never let you know",1
No I can't tell you nothing,1
Cause I'm a fucking mess sometimes,1
But still I could always be,1
Whatever you wanted,1
But not what you needed,1
Especially when you been needing me,1
Cause I'm a fucking mess sometimes,1
And I'll say what I don't mean,1
Just cause I wanted,1
Or maybe I need it,1
Swear lying's the only rush I need,1
Cause all I needed was some words to say,1
That all these feelings don't mean shit to me,1
"Cause it's all just chemicals anyway, anyway, yeah",1
And I got way too many routes to take,1
To make this all just go away,1
And find another heart to break,1
So heartless with the words I say,1
Just saying what I'm supposed to say,1
Cause I had nothing for you,1
I can't love when I can't even love myself,1
Things I would rather be thoughts at the back of my head,1
But I'm addicted to hurting,1
And I got these lungs,1
And I spent too many late nights,1
Just Thinking a hole in the earth,1
Till the sky is on fire,1
And my head still won't die,1
I guess I'm lying cause I wanna,1
I guess I'm lying cause I don't,1
Cause I just feel so tired,1
Like I need something to come alive,1
"She said, ""You ain't you when you're like this",1
"This ain't you, what you done?""",1
"And I said, ""That's the point""",1
You don't know how to let go,1
Who said this must be all or nothing?,1
"But I'm still caught below, and I'll never let you know",1
No I can't tell you nothing,1
Cause I'm a fucking mess sometimes,1
But still I could always be,1
"Whatever you wanted, but not what you needed",1
Especially when you been needing me,1
Cause I'm a fucking mess inside,1
And I'll say what I don't mean,1
"Just cause I wanted, or maybe I need it",1
Swear lying's the only rush I need,1
What is that funny light and sound,1
"Calling me, in my head, repeatedly?",1
What is that vision there in sight,1
Before my eyes?,1
So prominent,1
"So mesmerising, turbulent",1
You've got a hold on me,1
Your ingenuity,1
Seems to be driving me down on my knees,1
The force you generate,1
You reinvigorate,1
Your body tells them 'No mistakes',1
For I'm already drawn,1
Close to the divine,1
Intoxicating images are rushing through my mind,1
"Embodiment of sin, has seen a way within",1
Sensation seems to multiply,1
They're building up inside,1
Carried through the night,1
Radiating light,1
I see you move the crowd,1
I know what you're about,1
The stories I have heard,1
To talk about excess,1
I know what people say,1
But surely you impress?,1
Caressed by a pill,1
You elevated soul,1
Vanity and pride,1
An addict to one,1
A universal force,1
A one and only kind,1
A thing I can't control,1
No matter how I try,1
What have you done to me?,1
This kind of chemistry,1
Emotions running over me,1
And when you arch your back,1
Just when you stay like that,1
When it's natural to interact,1
When others holding back,1
Ready to commence,1
Caught up in your bliss,1
You're so confusing and intense,1
Synergy of two,1
Energy go wild,1
See the stars aligned to spell,1
Our name out in the sky,1
Jealousy in sight,1
So fascinating ride,1
So much faith between,1
Floating up the steam,1
Calling out so loud,1
Beautiful and true,1
Mystery about,1
Everything you do,1
Caressed by a drug,1
You elevated soul,1
Vanity and pride,1
An addict to one,1
A universal force,1
A one and only kind,1
A thing I can't control,1
No matter how I try,1
This electricity,1
Injected into me,1
Emotions running over me,1
And when you're getting close,1
You touch my innermost,1
A feeling deep inside me knows,1
On a floaty light,1
Carried through the night,1
We have got it all,1
I get through without,1
Flowing in my veins,1
Ribbing through my soul,1
I'll never be the same,1
The secret can't be told,1
Charismatic pill,1
You elevated soul,1
Vanity and pride,1
An addict to one,1
A universal force,1
A one and only kind,1
A thing I can't control,1
No matter how I try,1
Let me take you down,1
'Cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields,1
Nothing is real,1
And nothing to get hung about,1
Strawberry Fields forever,1
Living is easy with eyes closed,1
Misunderstanding all you see,1
It's getting hard to be someone,1
But it all works out,1
It doesn't matter much to me1,1
Let me take you down,1
'Cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields,1
Nothing is real,1
And nothing to get hung about,1
Strawberry Fields forever,1
No one I think is in my tree,1
I mean it must be high or low,1
That is you know you can't tune it,1
But it's all right,1
That is I think it's not too bad,1
Let me take you down,1
'Cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields,1
Nothing is real,1
And nothing to get hung about,1
Strawberry Fields forever,1
Always know sometimes it's me,1
But you know I know when it's a dream,1
"I think I know I mean a ""Yes""",1
But it's all wrong,1
That is I think I disagree,1
Let me take you down,1
'Cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields,1
Nothing is real,1
And nothing to get hung about,1
Strawberry Fields forever,1
Strawberry Fields forever,1
Strawberry Fields forever,1

I'm stepping through the door
And I'm floating in a most peculiar way
And the stars look very different today
For here
Am I sitting in a tin can
Far above the world

And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
Tell my wife I love her very much she knows

"Ah yeah, again and again!",1
"Wu-Tang Clan coming at you, protect your neck kid, so set it off the Inspector Deck",1
[Meth] watch your step kid [8X],1
I smoke on the mic like smoking Joe Frazier,1
"The hell raiser, raising hell with the flavor",1
Terrorize the jam like troops in Pakistan,1
Swinging through your town like your neighborhood Spiderman,1
"So uhh, tic toc and keep ticking",1
While I get you flipping off the shit I'm kicking,1
"The Lone Ranger, code red, danger!",1
Deep in the dark with the art to rip charts apart,1
"The vandal, too hot to handle",1
"you battle, you're saying Goodbye like Tevin Campbell",1
"Roughneck, Inspector Deck's on the set",1
"The rebel, I make more noise than heavy metal",1
"The way I make the crowd go wild, sit back relax won't smile",1
"Rae got it going on pal, call me the rap assassinator",1
Rhymes rugged and built like Schwarzenegger,1
"And I'm gonna get mad deep like a threat, blow up your project",1
Then take all your assets,1
Cause I came to shake the frame in half,1
"With the thoughts that bomb, shit like math!",1
So if you wanna try to flip go flip on the next man,1
Cause I grab the clip and,1
Hit you with sixteen shots and more I got,1
Going to war with the melting pot hot,1
It's the Method Man for short Mr. Meth,1
"Moving on your left, ah!",1
"And set it off, get it off, let it off like a gat",1
"I wanna break full, cock me back",1
"Small change, they putting shame in the game",1
I take aim and blow that nigga out the frame,1
"And like Fame, my style'll live forever",1
"Niggaz crossing over, but they don't know no better",1
"But I do, true, can I get a ""sue""",1
Nuff respect due to the one-six-oh,1
"I mean oh, you check out the flow",1
like the Hudson or PCP when I'm dusting,1
Niggaz off because I'm hot like sauce,1
The smoke from the lyrical blunt makes me [cough],1
"Oh, what, grab my nut get screwed",1
"Ow, here comes my Shaolin style",1
"Sloop, B. A. Buh-B. Y. U",1
"to my crew with the ""sue""",1
watch your step kid,1
[Ol Dirty Bastard] c'mon baby baby c'mon,1
"[RZA] Yo, you best protect your neck",1
First things first man you're fucking with the worst,1
I'll be sticking pins in your head like a fucking nurse,1
I'll attack any nigga who's slack in his mack,1
Come fully packed with a fat rugged stack,1
Shame on you when you stepped through to,1
The Ol Dirty Bastard straight from the Brooklyn Zoo,1
And I'll be damned if I let any man,1
"Come to my center, you enter the winter",1
Straight up and down that shit packed jam,1
"You can't slam, don't let me get fool on him man",1
The Ol Dirty Bastard is dirty and stinking,1
"Ason, unique rolling with the night of the creeps",1
Niggaz be rolling with a stash,1
"ain't saying cash, bite my style I'll bite your motherfucking ass!",1
For crying out loud my style is wild so book me,1
Not long is how long that this rhyme took me,1
"Ejecting, styles from my lethal weapon",1
My pen that rocks from here to Oregon,1
"Here's Mordigan, catch it like a psycho flashback",1
"I love gats, if rap was a gun, you wouldn't bust back",1
I come with shit that's all types of shapes and sounds,1
And where I lounge is my stomping grounds,1
I give a order to my peeps across the water,1
To go and snatch up props all around the border,1
And get far like a shooting star,1
'cause who I am is dim in the light of Pablo Escobar,1
Point blank as I kick the square biz,1
There it is you're fucking with pros and there it goes,1
You chill with the feedback black we don't need that,1
"It's ten o'clock hoe, where the fuck's your seed at?",1
"Feeling mad hostile, ran the apostle",1
Flowing like Christ when I speaks the gospel,1
Stroll with the holy roll then attack the globe with the buckus style,1
"the ruckus, ten times ten men committing mad sin",1
Turn the other cheek and I'll break your fucking chin,1
Slaying boom-bangs like African drums (we'll be),1
Coming around the mountain when I come,1
Crazy flamboyant for the rap enjoyment,1
My clan increase like black unemployment,1
"Yeah, another one dare,",1
Tuh-took a genius (to) take us the fuck outta here,1
The Wu is too slamming for these Cold Killing labels,1
Some ain't had hits since I seen Aunt Mabel,1
Be doing artists in like Cain did Abel,1
Now they money's gettin stuck to the gum under the table,1
That's what you get when you misuse what I invent,1
Your empire falls and you lose every cent,1
For trying to blow up a scrub,1
Now that thought was just as bright as a 20-watt light bulb,1
Should've pumped it when I rocked it,1
Niggaz so stingy they got short arms and deep pockets,1
This goes on in some companies,1
With majors they're scared to death to pump these,1
"First of all, who's your A&R",1
A mountain climber who plays an electric guitar,1
But he don't know the meaning of dope,1
When he's looking for a suit and tie rap,1
that's cleaner than a bar of soap,1
And I'm the dirtiest thing in sight,1
Matter of fact bring out the girls and let's have a mud fight,1
You take Sally and I'll take Sue,1
There ain't no difference between the two,1
"Cocaine, running all 'round my brain",1
"Headin' down Scott, turnin' up Main",1
Looking for that girl who sells cocaine,1
"Cocaine, runnin' all 'round my brain",1
Mmm momma come here quick,1
That old Cocaine 'bout to make me sick,1
"Cocaine, runnin' all 'round my brain",1
Late last night about a quarter past four,1
Ladanyi come knockin' down my hotel room door,1
Where's the cocaine?,1
It's runnin' all 'round my brain,1
I was talking to my doctor down at the hospital,1
"He said, ""Son, it says here you're twenty-seven",1
But that's impossible ...,1
"(Cocaine) You look like you could be forty-five.""",1
Now I'm losing touch with reality and I'm almost out of blow,1
It's such a fine line I hate to see it go,1
"Cocaine, runnin' all 'round my brain",1
I heard somebody fixed today,1
There was no last goodbyes to say,1
His will to live ran out,1
I heard somebody turned to dust,1
Looking back at what he left,1
A list of plans and photographs,1
Songs that never will be sung,1
These are the things he don't get done,1
"I've seen the man use the needle, seen the needle use the man",1
I've seen them crawl from the cradle to the gutter on their hands,1
"They fight a war but it's fatal, it's so hard to understand",1
"I've seen the man use the needle, seen the needle use the man",1
Just one shot to say goodbye,1
One last taste to mourn and cry,1
"Scores and shoots, the lights go dim",1
Just one shot to do him in,1
He hangs his head and wonders why,1
Why the monkey only lies,1
"But pay the pauper, he did choose",1
He hung his head inside the noose,1
"I've seen the man use the needle, seen the needle use the man",1
I've seen them crawl from the cradle to the gutter on their hands,1
"They fight a war but it's fatal, it's so hard to understand",1
"I've seen the man use the needle, seen the needle use the man",1
"Cryptic writing on the wall, the beginning of the end",1
"I've seen myself use the needle, seen the needle in my hand",1
Blood keeps drinking away,1
Certain of its destination,1
Driving through new orleans at night,1
Gotta find a destination,1
Just one fix,1
Life keeps slipping away,1
Fighting in a war with damnation,1
"Poised, keep cutting away",1
I'm looking in through to salvation,1
Just one fix,1
Like if I boarded a train,1
Trying to take in another station,1
Join us and the choice will be made,1
Unless we kill the lie as a nation,1

"Welcome, to some shit that’s considered legendary",1
I’m here to put the rap game in the cemetery,1
They told me it couldn’t happen,1
Ain’t no way in hell you gon' make millions off of rapping,1
But I’m just so determined,1
Catch me on the stage spitting verses like a sermon,1
You know I had to make 'em realize,1
"Lights, camera, action, mofucker check the real in my eyes",1
Now they all looking so surprised,1
"The dawn of a new era, like the sun I arise",1
"Through these lyrics, I am immortalized",1
Strictly spitting the truth but the rest is telling more lies,1
This the type of shit most people fantasize,1
But this the shit I used to analyze,1
They told me I was too underground,1
So I took the mic out my basement and found another sound,1
"I want it, I need it, I’m coming for the crown",1
"Can’t nobody stop me, I’m Rocky lets go another round",1
I’m kinda on my Roc-A-Fella meets Nelson Mandela,1
"Raining money, no umbrella flow",1
Most of these people they will never know,1
What you have to sacrifice as a person to truly grow,1
See I'm in love with this shorty right,1
But first I gotta get this story right,1
Cause in this business love will never last,1
"Sold out shows, hoes, and a whole lot of ass",1
Damn what a concoction,1
But these hoes ain't an option,1
Cause a woman what I'm looking for,1
A girl with wisdom that give me brain so insane,1
Or maybe I'm just going insane,1
"On the road to success, so I'm living in the fast lane",1
"You gotta be hustling, like",1
You gotta treat this like you selling drugs...,1

Too Marvelous For Words,0
Early Autumn,0
Ooooh...,0
"Lord, dear Lord above, God almighty,",0
"God of love, Please look down and see my people through.",0
I believe that God put sun and moon up in the sky.,0
I don't mind the gray skies,0
'cause they're just clouds passing by.,0
Heaven is a goodness time. A brighter light on high.,0
Do unto others as you would have them do to you.,0
And have a brighter by and by.,0
"Lord, dear Lord above, God almighty,",0
"God of love, Please look down and see my people through.",0
"I believe God is now, was then and always will be.",0
With God's blessing we can make it through eternity.,0
"Lord, dear Lord above, God almighty,",0
"God of love, Please look down and see my people through.",0
They say into your early life romance came,0
And in this heart of yours burned a flame,0
A flame that flickered one day and died away,0
"Then, with disillusion deep in your eyes",0
You learned that fools in love soon grow wise,0
"The years have changed you, somehow",0
I see you now,0
"Smoking, drinking, never thinking of tomorrow, nonchalant",0
"Diamonds shining, dancing, dining with some man in a restaurant",0
Is that all you really want?,0
"No, sophisticated lady,",0
"I know, you miss the love you lost long ago",0
And when nobody is nigh you cry,0
"Smoking, drinking, never thinking of tomorrow, nonchalant",0
"Diamonds shining, dancing, dining with some man in a restaurant",0
Is that all you really want?,0
"No, sophisticated lady,",0
"I know, you miss the love you lost long ago",0
And when nobody is nigh you cry,0
Sophisticated lady,0
You cry,0
"Hurry, hurry, hurry",0

Were never to be,0

What so proudly we hailed,0
At the twilight's last gleaming?,0
"Whose broad stripes and bright stars,",0
"Through the perilous fight,",0
"O'er the ramparts we watched,",0
Were so gallantly streaming?,0
"And the rockets' red glare,",0
"The bombs bursting in air,",0
Gave proof through the night,0
That our flag was still there.,0

O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave,0
